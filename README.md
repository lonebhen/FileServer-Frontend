## File Server


The File Server project aims to create a digital platform for document distribution. It provides a solution for businesses, like distributing wedding cards and admission forms, to various users. The goal is to scale the document distribution process by allowing easy and remote access to the files. Users can sign up and log in with their email and password, verify their accounts, and reset their passwords if needed. The platform features a feed page where users can find a list of downloadable files. A search functionality is also available to help users quickly find specific files. They can even send files to their email addresses directly through the platform. The admin user has the capability to upload files with titles and descriptions, and they can track the number of downloads and emails sent for each file.
